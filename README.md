# UPayments Store 

## Tech that I utilized
- React Query
- React Router
- React Bootstrap
- Axios

### Changes that I would have done (If I had time)
- Improve the ui a little bit by adding animation using React Spring
- Use Typescript for cleaner code
- Write some mock fetch tests and UI tests
- Write more DRY code (I feel like there's some repetetion)
- Add undo button after deleting and Item
